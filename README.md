# AVL Balancing Tree Algorithm

Project developed for Data Structure discipline - UFF / 2018  
Developed by: Jac√≥ Julio, Sandro Bonadia and Rolnado Machado  

## Project description

It's to develop an algorithm that simulates an AVL balancing tree. Also, to develop a form of visualization of the AVL tree.

## Prerequisite
